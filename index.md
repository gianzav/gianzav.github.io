# Buongiorno, sono Gianluca Zavan {.header}

And this is the laziest web page ever (with the flashiest font I found).

# About

I'm a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence & Cybersecurity at the
University of Udine (Italy) and Klagenfurt (Austria). I'm a member of
[MadrHacks](https://www.madrhacks.org/), the ethical hacking team of the
University of Udine, one of the top teams in Italy on [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/team/114509/).

I plan to graduate in April 2025, with a thesis titled "Automated planning for
production routines", written at Infineon Villach.

Even if changing constantly, my main interests are (not in order):

- Artificial Intelligence, both symbolic and sub-symbolic
- Software security
- Programming (currently learning Common Lisp)
- Beatboxing
- Videogames
- Tabletop games
- Reading all kinds of stuff
- Music with lots of synths and robot voices (Daft Punk I'm looking at you)
- Learning new stuff
- Exiting (Neo)Vim
- Linux, I use Arch btw


You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/gianzav) and
[Linkedin](https://it.linkedin.com/in/gianluca-zavan-0a3031293). If needed, you
can send me an email at `zavan.gianluca[at]gmail.com`.
