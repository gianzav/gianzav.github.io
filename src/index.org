:CUSTOM_ID: about
:END:
I'm a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence & Cybersecurity at the
University of Udine (Italy) and Klagenfurt (Austria). I'm a member of
[[https://www.madrhacks.org/][MadrHacks]], the ethical hacking team of
the University of Udine, one of the top teams in Italy on
[[https://ctftime.org/team/114509/][CTFtime]].

I plan to graduate in April 2025, with a thesis titled "Automated
planning for production routines", written at Infineon Villach.

Even if changing constantly, my main interests are (not in order):

- Artificial Intelligence, both symbolic and sub-symbolic
- Software security
- Programming (currently learning Common Lisp)
- Beatboxing
- Videogames
- Tabletop games
- Reading all kinds of stuff
- Music with lots of synths and robot voices (Daft Punk I'm looking at
  you)
- Learning new stuff
- Exiting (Neo)Vim
- Linux, I use Arch btw

You can find me on [[https://github.com/gianzav][Github]] and

needed, you can send me an email at =zavan.gianluca[at]outlook.com=.
