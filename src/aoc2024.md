# Advent of Code 2024 in Common Lisp
`</header>`{=html}


## Day 1

```lisp
(defun parse-input (lines)
  "Transforms the lists provided as two colums into two LISP lists."
  (values
   (mapcar #'(lambda (collection) (parse-integer (first (remove "" (split-by-one-space collection) :test #'string=)))) lines)
   (mapcar #'(lambda (collection) (parse-integer (second (remove "" (split-by-one-space collection) :test #'string=)))) lines)))

(defun read-and-parse-input (input-file)
  (parse-input (uiop:read-file-lines input-file)))

;; from https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/strings.html#breaking-strings-into-graphenes-sentences-lines-and-words
(defun split-by-one-space (string)
  (loop for i = 0 then (1+ j)
    as j = (position #\Space string :start i)
    collect (subseq string i j)
    while j))

(defun total-distance (list-1 list-2)
  (let ((sorted-1 (sort (copy-seq list-1) #'<))
    (sorted-2 (sort (copy-seq list-2) #'<)))
    (reduce #'+ (mapcar #'(lambda (x y) (abs (- x y))) sorted-1 sorted-2))))

(defun total-similarity (list-1 list-2)
  (let ((occurrences (make-hash-table)))
    (dolist (item list-1)
      (setf (gethash item occurrences) 0))
    (dolist (item list-2)
      (when (gethash item occurrences) (incf (gethash item occurrences))))
    (reduce #'+ (mapcar #'(lambda (item) (* item (gethash item occurrences))) list-1))))

(defun main ()
  (multiple-value-bind (x y) (read-and-parse-input "input")
    (format t "~a~%" (total-similarity x y))
    (format t "~a~%" (total-distance x y))))
```

## Day 2

In `utils.lisp` I'll move general functions defined over the AOC and that could
be useful for the next days.

```lisp
(load "../utils.lisp")

(defparameter *test*
  '((7 6 4 2 1)
    (1 2 7 8 9)
    (9 7 6 2 1)
    (1 3 2 4 5)
    (8 6 4 4 1)
    (1 3 6 7 9)))

(defun parse-file (lines)
  (mapcar #'(lambda (line) (mapcar #'parse-integer (utils:split-by-one-space line))) lines))

(defun read-and-parse-file (input-file)
  (parse-file (uiop:read-file-lines input-file)))


(defun check-pairs (sequence &optional (comparison-func #'<=))
  (loop for i from 1 below (length sequence) do
    (unless (funcall comparison-func (nth (1- i) sequence) (nth i sequence))
      (return-from check-pairs nil)))
  t)

(defun pair-distance-ok-p (x y &optional (min-distance 1) (max-distance 3))
  (let ((diff (abs (- x y))))
	(and (>= diff min-distance) (<= diff max-distance) )))

(defun distance-ok-p (sequence &optional (min-distance 1) (max-distance 3))
  (check-pairs sequence #'(lambda (x y) (pair-distance-ok-p x y min-distance max-distance))))

(defun check-safety (sequence)
  "A sequence of numbers is safe if it is monotonically decreasing or
increasing, and any adjacent numbers differ by at least one and at
most three."
  (cond ((< (first sequence) (second sequence))
	 (check-pairs sequence #'increasing-and-distance-p))
	((> (first sequence) (second sequence))
	 (check-pairs sequence #'decreasing-and-distance-p))
	(t nil)))

(defun increasing-and-distance-p (x y)
  (and (< x y) (pair-distance-ok-p x y)))

(defun decreasing-and-distance-p (x y)
  (and (> x y) (pair-distance-ok-p x y)))

(defun sequences-without-one-element (sequence)
  (loop for i from 0 below (length sequence) collect
	(append (subseq sequence 0 i) (subseq sequence (1+ i) (length sequence)))))

(defun solve (input-file)
   (let ((sequences (read-and-parse-file input-file)))
     (format t "~a~%" (solve-first sequences))
     (format t "~a~%" (solve-second sequences))
     ))

(defun solve-first (sequences)
    (reduce #'+ (mapcar #'(lambda (seq) (if (check-safety seq) 1 0)) sequences)))

(defun solve-second (sequences)
    (reduce #'+ (mapcar #'(lambda (seq) (if (some #'check-safety (sequences-without-one-element seq)) 1 0)) sequences)))

```

## Day 3

### Easy, sane version

Just use `grep` to pre-process the file, or an available regex library.

- 3.1: `grep "mul([0-9][0-9]*,[0-9][0-9]*)" input > preprocessed-1`
- 3.2: `grep -e "mul([0-9][0-9]*,[0-9][0-9]*) -e "do()" -e "don't()" input >
preprocessed-2`

Then do the parsing and calculations in CL:

```lisp

(defun get-valid-muls (mixed &optional (valid-region t))
  (let ((valid '()) (valid-region valid-region))
    (loop for string in mixed do
      (cond
	((string= string "do()") (setq valid-region t))
	((string= string "don't()") (setq valid-region nil))
	(valid-region (setq valid (append valid (list string))))))
    (values valid valid-region)))

(defun parse-mul (mul-string)
  (let* ((comma (position "," mul-string :test #'string=))
	 (left (parse-integer (subseq mul-string 4 comma)))
	 (right (parse-integer
       (subseq mul-string (1+ comma) (position ")" mul-string :test #'string=)))))
    (* left right)))

(defun mul-and-add-line (mul-line)
    (reduce #'+ (mapcar #'parse-mul mul-line)))

(defun parse-mul (mul-string)
  (let* ((comma (position "," mul-string :test #'string=))
	 (left (parse-integer (subseq mul-string 4 comma)))
	 (right (parse-integer (subseq mul-string (1+ comma) (position ")" mul-string :test #'string=)))))
    (* left right)))

(defun solve-1-preprocessed (file)
  (let* ((line (uiop:read-file-lines file)))
    (mul-and-add-line line)))

(defun solve-2-preprocessed (file)
  (let ((line (get-valid-muls (uiop:read-file-lines file))))
	(mul-and-add-line line)))
```

### The hard way

So, actually I didn't want to install a regex library, so I implemented my wonky
regex engine by hard-coding the needed DFAs. The following is an example of how
an automaton is defined:

```lisp
(defstruct automaton (init nil) (end nil) (delta '()))

(defparameter *delta*
  '((0 - "m" -> 1)
    (1 - "u" -> 2)
    (2 - "l" -> 3)
    (3 - "(" -> 4)
    (4 - number -> 5)
    (5 - number -> 5)
    (5 - "," -> 6)
    (6 - number -> 7)
    (7 - number -> 7)
    (7 - ")" -> 8)))
```

Where the numbers represent states, the arrow is labeled with the symbol that
enables the transition, and `number` represents the `[0-9]` set of chars. The
actual matching on automata is handled in the following way (some things can
easily be optimized e.g. with hash maps):

```lisp
(defun rule-with-input (rules input)
  "returns the single rule that have input on the arrow"
  (let ((rule-list (remove-if-not #'(lambda (rule) (string= (third rule) input)) rules)))
    (if rule-list (first rule-list) nil)))

(defun rule-with-number (rules)
  "returns the single rule that have -number->"
  (let ((rule-list (remove-if-not #'(lambda (rule) (eql (third rule) 'number)) rules)))
    (if rule-list (first rule-list) nil)))

(defun rules-with-state (rules state)
  "returns list of rules for state"
    (remove-if-not #'(lambda (rule) (eql (first rule) state)) rules))

(defun target-state (rule)
  (fifth rule))


(defun apply-delta-char (delta state input)
  "Apply delta on a single char string."
  (let ((to-apply (rule-with-input (rules-with-state delta state) input)))
    (cond
      ((equal delta nil) nil)
      (to-apply
       (target-state to-apply))
      ((and (position input "0123456789" :test #'string=) (rule-with-number (rules-with-state delta state)))
       (target-state (rule-with-number (rules-with-state delta state))))
      (t nil))))

(defun apply-delta-string (delta state input end-state)
  (apply-delta-string-aux delta state (concatenate 'string input (princ-to-string (code-char 1))) end-state 0))

(defun apply-delta-string-aux (delta state input end-state position)
  "Apply delta on a string"
  (cond ((equal state end-state) (list t position))
	((equal state nil) (list nil (if (> position 1) (1- position) position)))
	(t (apply-delta-string-aux delta (apply-delta-char delta state (subseq input 0 1)) (subseq input 1) end-state (1+ position)))))


(defun check-multiple-automaton (automaton-list input)
  (let ((max 0))
    (loop for automaton in automaton-list do
      (let ((possible-match
	      (apply-delta-string
	       (automaton-delta automaton)
	       (automaton-init automaton)
	       input
	       (automaton-end automaton))))
	(cond
	  ((first possible-match) (return-from check-multiple-automaton possible-match))
	  (t (if (> (second possible-match) max) (setq max (second possible-match)))))
	))
    (list nil max)))

(defun apply-on-automaton-list (automaton-list input)
  "Run the automaton on the input string and return the list of matches"
  (let ((i 0) (matches '()))
    (loop while (< i (length input))
	  do
	     (destructuring-bind
		 (result char-read)
		 (check-multiple-automaton automaton-list (subseq input i))
	       (cond
		 (result
		  (setq matches (append matches (list (subseq input i (+ i char-read)))))
		  (incf i char-read))
		 (t (incf i char-read)))))
    matches))
```

With `apply-on-automaton-list` it's possible to use multiple automata for the
matching. The solution is completed as following:

```lisp
(defparameter *mul-automaton* (make-automaton :init 0 :end 8 :delta
					  '((0 - "m" -> 1)
					    (1 - "u" -> 2)
					    (2 - "l" -> 3)
					    (3 - "(" -> 4)
					    (4 - number -> 5)
					    (5 - number -> 5)
					    (5 - "," -> 6)
					    (6 - number -> 7)
					    (7 - number -> 7)
					    (7 - ")" -> 8))))

(defparameter *do-automaton* (make-automaton :init 0 :end 4 :delta
					     '((0 - "d" -> 1)
					       (1 - "o" -> 2)
					       (2 -> "(" -> 3)
					       (3 -> ")" -> 4))))

(defparameter *dont-automaton* (make-automaton :init 0 :end 7 :delta
					       '((0 - "d" -> 1)
						 (1 - "o" -> 2)
						 (2 - "n" -> 3)
						 (3 - "'" -> 4)
						 (4 - "t" -> 5)
						 (5 - "(" -> 6)
						 (6 - ")" -> 7))))


(defun solve-1 (file)
  (let* ((lines (uiop:read-file-lines file))
	(parsed-lines (mapcar #'(lambda (line) (apply-on-automaton *mul-automaton* line)) lines)))
    (reduce #'+ (mapcar #'mul-and-add-line parsed-lines))
    ))

(defun solve-2 (file)
  (let* ((lines (uiop:read-file-lines file))
	 (valid-region t)
	 (valid-muls '()))
    (loop for line in lines do
      (multiple-value-bind (valid last-valid-region)
	  (get-valid-muls
	   (apply-on-automaton-list (list *mul-automaton* *do-automaton* *dont-automaton*) line) valid-region)
	(push valid valid-muls)
	(setq valid-region last-valid-region)))
    (reduce #'+ (mapcar #'mul-and-add-line valid-muls))))
```

It would be really nice to automatically compile at least a subset of the regex
syntax into the equivalent automaton, but this is left as an exercise *for future me, maybe*.

## Utils

```lisp
(defpackage :utils
  (:use :cl)
  (:export
   #:string-join #:split-by-one-space))

(in-package :utils)

(defun string-join (fill-in strings)
  (let ((joined (first strings)))
    (dolist (s (rest strings))
      (setf joined (concatenate 'string joined fill-in s)))
    joined))

;; from https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/strings.html#breaking-strings-into-graphenes-sentences-lines-and-words
(defun split-by-one-space (string)
  (loop for i = 0 then (1+ j)
	as j = (position #\Space string :start i)
	collect (subseq string i j)
	while j))
```
