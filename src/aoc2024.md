# Advent of Code 2024 in Common Lisp
`</header>`{=html}


## Day 1

```lisp
(defun parse-input (lines)
  "Transforms the lists provided as two colums into two LISP lists."
  (values
   (mapcar #'(lambda (collection) (parse-integer (first (remove "" (split-by-one-space collection) :test #'string=)))) lines)
   (mapcar #'(lambda (collection) (parse-integer (second (remove "" (split-by-one-space collection) :test #'string=)))) lines)))

(defun read-and-parse-input (input-file)
  (parse-input (uiop:read-file-lines input-file)))

;; from https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/strings.html#breaking-strings-into-graphenes-sentences-lines-and-words
(defun split-by-one-space (string)
  (loop for i = 0 then (1+ j)
    as j = (position #\Space string :start i)
    collect (subseq string i j)
    while j))

(defun total-distance (list-1 list-2)
  (let ((sorted-1 (sort (copy-seq list-1) #'<))
    (sorted-2 (sort (copy-seq list-2) #'<)))
    (reduce #'+ (mapcar #'(lambda (x y) (abs (- x y))) sorted-1 sorted-2))))

(defun total-similarity (list-1 list-2)
  (let ((occurrences (make-hash-table)))
    (dolist (item list-1)
      (setf (gethash item occurrences) 0))
    (dolist (item list-2)
      (when (gethash item occurrences) (incf (gethash item occurrences))))
    (reduce #'+ (mapcar #'(lambda (item) (* item (gethash item occurrences))) list-1))))

(defun main ()
  (multiple-value-bind (x y) (read-and-parse-input "input")
    (format t "~a~%" (total-similarity x y))
    (format t "~a~%" (total-distance x y))))
```

## Day 2

In `utils.lisp` I'll move general functions defined over the AOC and that could
be useful for the next days.

```
(load "../utils.lisp")

(defparameter *test*
  '((7 6 4 2 1)
    (1 2 7 8 9)
    (9 7 6 2 1)
    (1 3 2 4 5)
    (8 6 4 4 1)
    (1 3 6 7 9)))

(defun parse-file (lines)
  (mapcar #'(lambda (line) (mapcar #'parse-integer (utils:split-by-one-space line))) lines))

(defun read-and-parse-file (input-file)
  (parse-file (uiop:read-file-lines input-file)))


(defun check-pairs (sequence &optional (comparison-func #'<=))
  (loop for i from 1 below (length sequence) do
    (unless (funcall comparison-func (nth (1- i) sequence) (nth i sequence))
      (return-from check-pairs nil)))
  t)

(defun pair-distance-ok-p (x y &optional (min-distance 1) (max-distance 3))
  (let ((diff (abs (- x y))))
	(and (>= diff min-distance) (<= diff max-distance) )))

(defun distance-ok-p (sequence &optional (min-distance 1) (max-distance 3))
  (check-pairs sequence #'(lambda (x y) (pair-distance-ok-p x y min-distance max-distance))))

(defun check-safety (sequence)
  "A sequence of numbers is safe if it is monotonically decreasing or
increasing, and any adjacent numbers differ by at least one and at
most three."
  (cond ((< (first sequence) (second sequence))
	 (check-pairs sequence #'increasing-and-distance-p))
	((> (first sequence) (second sequence))
	 (check-pairs sequence #'decreasing-and-distance-p))
	(t nil)))

(defun increasing-and-distance-p (x y)
  (and (< x y) (pair-distance-ok-p x y)))

(defun decreasing-and-distance-p (x y)
  (and (> x y) (pair-distance-ok-p x y)))

(defun sequences-without-one-element (sequence)
  (loop for i from 0 below (length sequence) collect
	(append (subseq sequence 0 i) (subseq sequence (1+ i) (length sequence)))))

(defun solve (input-file)
   (let ((sequences (read-and-parse-file input-file)))
     (format t "~a~%" (solve-first sequences))
     (format t "~a~%" (solve-second sequences))
     ))

(defun solve-first (sequences)
    (reduce #'+ (mapcar #'(lambda (seq) (if (check-safety seq) 1 0)) sequences)))

(defun solve-second (sequences)
    (reduce #'+ (mapcar #'(lambda (seq) (if (some #'check-safety (sequences-without-one-element seq)) 1 0)) sequences)))

```

## Utils

```lisp
(defpackage :utils
  (:use :cl)
  (:export
   #:string-join #:split-by-one-space))

(in-package :utils)

(defun string-join (fill-in strings)
  (let ((joined (first strings)))
    (dolist (s (rest strings))
      (setf joined (concatenate 'string joined fill-in s)))
    joined))

;; from https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/strings.html#breaking-strings-into-graphenes-sentences-lines-and-words
(defun split-by-one-space (string)
  (loop for i = 0 then (1+ j)
	as j = (position #\Space string :start i)
	collect (subseq string i j)
	while j))
