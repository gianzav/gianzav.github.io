# Common Lisp resources

`</header>`{=html}


Some links that point to resources I want to remember about, and that can be
useful for others. This is part of my journey on learning Common Lisp.

- [Practical Common Lisp](https://gigamonkeys.com/book/): a great introduction
  on the main aspects of the language
- [Common Lisp Recipes](https://softouch.on.ca/kb/data/Common%20Lisp%20Recipes.pdf): CL patterns, to be consulted on need
- [On Lisp](https://paulgraham.com/onlisp.html): advanced Lisp techniques
- [Common Lisp HyperSpec](https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/StartPts.htm)
- [Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp](https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp/tree/main)
