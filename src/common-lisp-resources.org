Some links that point to resources I want to remember about, and that
can be useful for others. This is part of my journey on learning Common
Lisp.

- [[https://gigamonkeys.com/book/][Practical Common Lisp]]: a great
  introduction on the main aspects of the language
- [[https://softouch.on.ca/kb/data/Common%20Lisp%20Recipes.pdf][Common
  Lisp Recipes]]: CL patterns, to be consulted on need
- [[https://paulgraham.com/onlisp.html][On Lisp]]: advanced Lisp
  techniques
- [[https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/StartPts.htm][Common
  Lisp HyperSpec]]
- [[https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp/tree/main][Paradigms of
  Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp]]
